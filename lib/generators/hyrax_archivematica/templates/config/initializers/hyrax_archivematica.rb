# change, if there has not we will not expect that the Start AM job will be subsequently started by the above and we acn asses
# whether the metadata change trigger the significant metadata conditions for an AIP update
# We insert BEFORE the CreateWithFilesActor (in this case swapped with CreateWithFilesOrderedMembersActor) has deleted the uploaded files
